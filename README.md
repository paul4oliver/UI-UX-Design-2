<h3>In this project, I demonstrate my ability to analyze user interface/user experience design fundamentals and develop user interface/user experience for embedded and cloud-based systems based on data from Kiva, a non-profit organization that allows individuals to lend money via the internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students in nearly 100 countries, and the following user stories:</h3>

<i>As a Kiva borrower, I want to access information about Kiva and about borrowing from Kiva with my flip-phone (which is an embedded device), so that I can stay informed, request loans, and track my loan payback process.<br>

As a Kiva lender, I want to explore borrower requests, analyze my and othersâ€™ lending data, and follow borrower loan payments (in a cloud application) so that I can forecast how I will loan funds and plan the recycling of previous paid funds.</i>
<h3>To complete the project I performed the following:</h3>

<b>One</b><br>
Evaluated the data requirements for borrowers.<br>
Assessed specific borrower stories to refine their data needs.<br>
Recommended borrower data priorities for UI/UX development.<br>
Evaluated the data requirements for lenders.<br>

<b>Two</b><br>
Designed a UI/UX paper prototype for the main screen of the embedded application.<br>
Explained how users will access the data.<br>
Justified why the design is suited for the user.<br>
Discussed how creativity is balanced with the code of conduct Kiva provides.<br>

<b>Three</b><br>
Created appropriate features for a digital wireframe to address the goals of the project.<br>
Created clear navigation and actions for users of the wireframe.<br>
Applied design best practices to the digital wireframe.<br>
Explained the rationale behind design choices.<br>
Recommended how the design could be adapted for a cloud-based system.<br>
